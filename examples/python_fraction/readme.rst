Fraction of time in python
==========================

See ``python_faction.tex`` for more information. This code suite is probably fragile because
scalene seems to do major updates that change the output format.

Edit and run a copy of ``tests.sh`` using, e.g. ``$ SOLVER=gurobi mpiexec -np 3 ./tests_ssn.sh``

Then edit and run a copy of ``farmer_summary.bash``
